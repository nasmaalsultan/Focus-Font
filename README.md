# Focus-Font
A browser-based accessibility tool that converts text from images into a dyslexia-friendly reading format. Uses Tesseract.js for on-device OCR, a Bionic Reading toggle for readability, and an optional dictionary lookup in multiple languages.

**Focus Font** helps users extract text from images and view it in an easier-to-read format.
It uses [Tesseract.js](https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js) for OCR (text recognition), adds an optional **Bionic Reading** mode to enhance focus, and includes an integrated multilingual dictionary lookup.
